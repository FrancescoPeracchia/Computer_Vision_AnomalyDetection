# ManTra-Net 
Here is preseted a Computer Vision project that use the distributed network ManTra-Net reported  in https://github.com/ISICV/ManTraNet, our work is try to use and adapt the network to our dataset.

ManTra-Net is an end to end network that performs detection and localization of manipulations over an image without extra pre-processing and post-processingm is a fully convolutional network and can take in input images of arbitrary sizes and can handle 385 manipulation types such as : splicing, copy-move, removal and so on.
