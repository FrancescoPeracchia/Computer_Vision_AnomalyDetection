# ManTra-Net 
Here is preseted a Computer Vision project that use the distributed network ManTra-Net reported  in https://github.com/ISICV/ManTraNet, our work is try to use and adapt the network to our dataset.

End to end network that performs detection and localization without extra pre-processing and post-processing.
Fully convolutional network and can handle images of arbitrary sizes.
Can handle 385 manipulation types such as : splicing, copy-move, removal and so onâ€‹.
